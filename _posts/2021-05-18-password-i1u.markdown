Authentication is increasingly becoming important in the internet and as long alternatives are not wide spread, secure passwords are very <!--more-->important. There are several measures to ensure your password is secure like not to use the same password for different services, use a random string, and most important don't use a password that a random dude on the internet is recommending. Let's put all these measures aside. The other day, I learned that some people use URLs as password. It is not recommended to do that, but we don't want to listen to that for a moment, remember that? 

If you are looking for a URL that you can use as a password, you could consider my homepage [www.i1u.de][homepage]. It's brief and you can remember it easily and look if you capitalize some letter, [www.I1U.de][homepage] has everything most password validators require: upper and lower case letters, number, special characters, and it has 10 characters. Perfect. 
I'm not saying you should use it as your password. I'm just saying if you do, I don't mind.
